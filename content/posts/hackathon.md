# My Hackathon Experience

I have attended two hackathons during my graduate study. One is within my school (CWRU) and another one is hosted by Tiktok. My exprience of these two hackathon are entirely different. Although I am just a novice in software development and the projects I have accomplished are very simple, I still love to attend Hackathon and create cool project with my own idea.

## CWRU Hackathon

I am fortunate to have met my teammate in a class. And she bring her friend who is a Ph.D in robotic to participate in this contest.  We developed a game using an EMG equipment developed by \[Backyard Brains]\([https://backyardbrains.com/](https://backyardbrains.com/)) to control the player to kill enemy. The EMG equipment is set up by putting the sensor onto the subject's forearm and connecting to arduino IDE. After openning up the IDE and write a simple arduino embedding code, the sensor can detect a signal burst when subject contract it's arm muscle. This signal burst is then be used to control the player to perform movement, such as when the signal reach 50, the player perform the killing animation and kill the enemy within its attack range. There is a convenient Unity package that can listen to the specific port and output its value. We used the package to let Unity game listen to the value sent by Arduino in real-time for player control.

After showcasing our idea to the judges, we get a positive feedback and a second place reward. Although my teammate think that we should get the first place, I am still grateful for the result.

If you are interesting in this idea, you can take a look at our github repo: [https://github.com/cricel/MusicGame.git](https://github.com/cricel/MusicGame.git)

> Software Use: Unity, Arduino\
> Language Use: Unity C#, Arduino C++
